This is a rough and not entirely accurate CHANGELOG of what has been changed. Largely I am using it to keep track of what things I want to change outside of the theme folder (e.g. views).

5-10-2011

Themed a lot more pages although there are still some rough spots. In addition I've made some changes outside of the theme.

Changed and Exported Views and Contexts:

Teams View
 - change it from 4 rows to 3 rows.

Sitewide View
 - I got rid of the DYCO menu block. I actually handle this in a preprocess function in template.php. If, god forbid, you add this theme and the site goes down or blank, template.php and page.tpl.php $mainmenu are things to look at.

Team Page Context
 - Moved team information and logo to content-top. Also removed some unnecessary blocks in the sidebar such as team captain login since this should be on every page at the top anyway.

Anonymous Front Context
 - remove the create and manage team links because they are always at the top.

Changed Modules:

dr_base.module
 - removed the Create Team Blog Post link since we are no longer doing these.
 - I corrected the Support A Team link to point to the teams page (before it pointed to register or something because I didn't know the path).

As always, you want to clear the data cache in Performance for some of these changes to take effect.
